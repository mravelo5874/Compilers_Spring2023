Feedback:
I would say that this was the most difficult assignment in this course so far. Getting LLVM
setup took up a lot of time. Additionally, having the due date for this assignmnet be only a
few days after the midterm was challenging; I spent most of my time before the exam studying.
I would also like to mention that I was having internet issues all week starting on Saturday
before the due date on Sunday. My internet issues are still a problem but I was able to change
locations to be able to work on my assignemnts during the week. I have already sent you an 
email as I'm sure you are aware. I would greatly appreciate it if no lateness reductions were
done to my grade as these circumstances were out of my control. Thank you again for your
understanding. 

Partner:
I did not have a partner for this assignment. All code was written by me.
